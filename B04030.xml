            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

He was lineally decended from a Noble Family, and a man of an undaunted and unconquered spirit,
<pb facs="tcp:179497:4"/> in-somuch that whosoever beheld him could not chuse but conclude him to be what he sÃ©emed a Noble PÃ©er of <hi>Englands</hi> Realm. He was also highly honoured of the King, who bestowed his only Daughter on him for his wife, these two were the worthy Parents of this most Noble, Famous, and Victorious Champion S. <hi>George.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was born a Champion, for no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had nature brought him into the world but he proved an unfortunate Champion, his birth causing her death who gave him life: which sad and heavy chance was agrÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a former Dream which his Lady Mother apprehended, who dreamed often for many nights together before the time of her delivery, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> she brought forth a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon into the world, that should be the death of her that bare him: which constant dream caused some destruction in the distressed Lady, insomuch y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> she could not be quiet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till she had revealed and publisht it unto her Lord, &amp; withall requested him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult with these Sages and Wisemen then living, what her dream might pretend? her loving Lord unwilling to deny any request that she should make, did post hast unto the Oracle and requested an interpretatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Lord <hi>Alber</hi> having heard this Report from the Oracle, departed very heavy, and full of grief. for the hearing of his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Ladies death, was as full of grief un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as the news of his son could be of joy: but no sooner had he set footing againe within his own Palace, but found the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles report to be too true, for though he had a son, yet he lost his wife.

            <p>The last valiant Act of his, which crownd both himself, and his other most Noble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes with deserved honour was his killing that horrid Egyptian Dragon, who greedy of humane blood, could not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied untill he had devoured all the Virgins in Egypt.</p>
            <p>Thus did the Dragons fury daily make one or other childless, so that there was but one Virgin left, only <hi>Sabrian</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The horrid aspect of the Monster struck S. <hi>George</hi> with terrour and amazement, but being of an undaunted spirit he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the encounter, and directs his tried and well proved Launce against his well proved sides, but all too little or no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, for that being not to be pierced, S <hi>George</hi> was almost quite out of hope to wound his craly sloes, till at the last it so fortuned that S <hi>George</hi> struck the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon on the back, and whilst the Monster was opening his jaws to cast a venomous flood of deadly poyson upon the Knight, S. <hi>George letting no opportunity</hi> slip, strikes his Iavelin down his throat, who

               <l>two hungry Lyons fierce and fell;</l>
               <l>And tore the Eunuch presently,</l>
               <l>in pieces small the truth to tell;</l>
               <l>Down by the Lady then they laid,</l>
               <l>Whereby it seem'd she was a Maid.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when S. <hi>George</hi> from hunting came</l>
               <l>and did behold this heavy chance,</l>
               <l>Yet for his lovely Virgins sake,</l>
               <l>his courage then he did advance,</l>
               <l>And came into the Lyons sight,</l>
               <l>Who ran at him with all their might.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But he being no whit dismaid,</l>
               <l>but like a stout and valiant Knight,</l>
               <l>Did kill the hungry Lyons both</l>
               <l>within the Lady <hi>Sabrines</hi> sight:</l>
               <l>But all this while sad and demure,</l>
               <l>She stood most like a Virgin pure.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then when S. <hi>George</hi> did surely know</l>
               <l>this Lady was a Virgin true,</l>
               <l>His doleful thoughts that ere were dump</l>
               <l>began most firmly to renew;</l>
               <l>He set her on a Palfc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <l>and towards <hi>England</hi> came with spÃ©ed.</l>

               <l>Where he arrived in short space</l>
